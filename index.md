<!-- Update:

I will probably join University of Cambridge for CS PhD this coming October! Shoot me a message if you want to chat about academics, startup, vc, fashion etc.  -->


## About me

I’m a second year PhD student in the Department of CST at University of Cambridge, advised by Prof. [Rafal Mantiuk](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rkm38/). My current research interest lies in the intersection field of **Computer Graphics** and **Machine Learning**. My research background includes content adaptive rendering and real-time 3D Reconstruction.


Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in **pure math** at University of Toronto, and Msc. degree in **computer engineering** at McGill University, where I was gratefully supervised by [Prof. Derek Nowrouzezahrai](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/) and [Prof. Morgan McGuire](https://casual-effects.com/morgan/index.html).

Beyond research, I enjoy reading, fashion, and the arts. I'm particularly interested in psychoanalysis as well as both Eastern and Western philosophy.

Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested in research collaboration❤️

### [Real-Time Scene Reconstruction using Light Field Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14624)

Our research explores novel view synthesis methods that reconstruct complex scenes without relying on explicit geometry data. Our approach leverages sparse real-world images to generate multi-scale implicit representations of scene geometries.
A key innovation is our probe data structure, which captures highly accurate depth information from dense data points. This allows us to reconstruct detailed scenes at a lower computational cost, making rendering performance independent of scene complexity. Additionally, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than handling explicit scene geometry, making our method ideal for large-scale rendering applications.

<!-- studying Computer Engineering. In parallel, I’ve been working as a research assistant at the McGill Graphics Lab (MGL), advised by Prof. Derek Nowrouzezahrai.

I am currently working on the neural representations of 3D scenes and am grateful to be supervised by Prof. Derek Nowrouzezahrai and Prof. Morgan Mcguire. I’m also broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning, and other topics about computer graphics, e.g. rendering, virtual reality, and augmented reality 

Previously, I specialized in mathematics (75% theoretical math, 25% applied math), and minor in computer science at University of Toronto. Before returning to master, I spent some time in the industry, cofounding Willow, Canada's first real estate investing platform, and worked at HSBC Bank Canada.

Other than my research work, I love reading, fashion and arts. Psychoanalysis, eastern and western philosophy have been my favorite subjects; life philosphy greatly influenced by I Ching, Plato and Francis Bacon; chilhood's fav is L'Étoile by Edgar Degas but fascinated by Piet Mondrian and Barnett Newman's work these days.
However, research work is my passion, and rest of them are hobbies.
